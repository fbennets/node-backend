## Language

Everything code-related, including the documentation is in english.

Open Decision is based in Germany and for now targeted at and tested by a mostly german audience.
This is why the User Interface is in german at the moment.
There is however no reason to restrict the software to one country and one language, so feel free to start developing an english version.

Communication on [Slack](open-decision.org/slack)
and other Channels is in german, although english is equally fine.
